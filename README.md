# Hi there 👋 My name is Alex 🙋‍♂️ Welcome to my profile 

I am passionate about testing and making a quality product. To automate the testing process, I continue to learn programming languages such as Javascript and Typescript and find them incredibly interesting. Among other things, I'm hooked on frameworks like Playwright, WebdriverIo and Cypress. Awaysome things!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/Typescript (as using them to write tests)
- 👯 I like to find ways to solve various non-trivial problems in testing 
- 📫 Being part of a team that is responsible for creating a quality product is really cool.
