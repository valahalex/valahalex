# Hi there 👋

## Welcome to my profile 🙋‍♂️

My name is Alex, and I'm passionate about Testing. To automate the testing process, I continue to learn programming languages such as Javascript and Typescript and find them incredibly interesting. Among other things, I'm hooked on frameworks like Playwright, WebdriverIo and Cypress. Awaysome things!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/Typescript (as using them to write tests)
- 👯 I like to find ways to solve various non-trivial problems in testing 
- 📫 Being part of a team that is responsible for creating a quality product is really cool.
